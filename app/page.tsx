// I'm a senior frontend software engineer with a passion for UI/UX and over 18 years experience building for the web, available early 2025 for React-based contracts.

// I'm an old hand at fresh component library builds. I love talking to creatives on their own terms, translating and pulling assets out of creative comps in Photoshop or Figma, adding interstitial layouts & interactions that those don't cover, identifying UX breakdowns early.

// I also love diving into legacy systems to update, refactor and debug. Over the years I've learned (and forgotten) a bewildering array of frameworks, patterns and templating syntaxes and I'm sure that will continue!

// React has been my focus since 2018 with recent work including forms with React Hook Form or Formik, data fetching / state management with React-Query or Redux Toolkit, SSR with Next.js and Gatsby, testing with RTL, Playwright, Optimizely and Chromium. Mostly Typescript these days but JS is fine. Fluent in various CSS patterns.

        for big names like Intel, Vauxhall, Nationwide, Colgate and Premier Inn,
        always building with a mind to accessibility and internationalisation.

        In 2014 I transitioned into contracting, expanding my scope to work with
        smaller agencies and in-house teams. From content-driven sites to SPAs
        to complex product platforms I became well versed in quickly picking up
        new frameworks, design patterns and legacy codebases.

              My first dev task in 2006 was reducing the size of the CSS file
              for a well-trafficked Intel site, so it&apos;s continued from
              there: CSS3 (Sass, LESS, Stylus), BEM / SMACSS-based architecture.
              JS modules, styled components, styled system, styled jsx, JSS,
              TSS, frameworks like Chakra-ui, light and dark modes, and lately a
              lot of Tailwind.

              As I&rsquo;m happiest building UIs my first JavaScript specific
              role wasn&rsquo;t until in 2014, but by 2018 I had pivoted to JS
              and the React ecosystem completely, the last 4 years of which
              being in TypeScript. SPAs, NextJS v12 and v13, client and
              server-side rendered apps, RESTful APIs, state management with
              Redux, Context or React Query, GraphQL. I&rsquo;ve also worked in
              Astro, Gatsby, React Native, a slew of other now outdated
              frameworks, regularly contributing to Node backends and had
              exposure to a range of others.

              breakdowns early, adding interstitial layouts &amp; interactions
              etc, I always prefer collaborating with visual designers and
              ux-ers, directly and via tools like Storybook, Chromatic and
              Atomic Design, to ensure a consistent language is used from the
              outset across departments. This aids both with rapid prototyping
              in greenfield component library builds as well as maintaining a
              living design system in larger codebases.
