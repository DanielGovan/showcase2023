// TODO
// What Next 15 features are available? I hate that all the pages are called "page.tsx" tbh but

// Fill out the pages with whatever comes to mind. Focus on fun and voice.
// Add a footer with links to social media, GitHub, etc.
// Make 3 case studies based on the three sites I have access to.
// Add a link to the CV pages to download the CV as a printed PDF, will need an external library for this

// LATER
// Add a dark mode toggle??

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      Welcome! Add intro, links, etc. to this page. This is the home page of the
      CV site.
