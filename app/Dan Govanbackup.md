Dan Govan
Senior Front End / Full Stack developer passionate about UI/UX, with nearly 20 years of web experience. Looking to join a curious, collaborative and forward-looking team.

Skills
JS Frameworks
Focused on the evolving React ecosystem since 2018, lately in Next.js. Recent experience with Astro, previously Gatsby and React Native. Excited to keep exploring emerging tech.

Styling
Lately Tailwind, before that frameworks like Chakra-UI, then styled-components, styled-system, JSS, TSS, CSS modules, and earlier CSS3 (Sass, LESS, Stylus) with BEM / SMACSS.

Semantics
Many early projects with international brands like Vauxhall and Colgate gave me a strong background in semantic HTML, with a mind to accessibility, SEO, and responsive or device-agnostic design, essential for scalability and localisation.

JavaScript
Mainly using TypeScript for SPAs and SSR apps in Experience includes REST APIs, Redux, Context, React Query, and GraphQL. Some backend in Node and PHP, keen to expand to full-stack roles.

Testing
E2E with Playwright and Cypress. Unit testing with Jest, React Testing Library. AB testing with Optimizely, visual regression with Chromatic.

Design systems
Very comfortable extracting assets from comps (Photoshop to Figma), identifying UX gaps, and prototyping in Storybook. Prefer close collaboration with designers to align on scalable, living systems, from rapid prototyping to styleguide alignment.

Knowledge sharing
Value pairing, code reviews, and mentorship opportunities in cross-functional teams.

Tooling
VS Code, Docker, Webpack, Yarn/PNPM, Git. CI/CD with Travis, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions. Project management in Jira, Trello, Fibery.

Experience
Software Engineer
Altium: Sept 2023 - Dec 2024
Contract, Cambridge, Remote
Joining Altium's Octopart in-house web team at an exciting time of investment and team growth we overhauled a legacy codebase on a component comparison website with 2.3 million monthly users.

I led on a move from Styled JSX to Tailwind for improved site performance and DX, supported by documenting components in Storybook and Chromatic for visual regression testing, and implementing a new design system and style guide for visual consistency.

The new team took ownership for tech debt as well as new features so on top of new search filters for better UX and landing pages for better SEO we were able to add Playwright e2e tests, and move to pnpm, upgrade the GraphQL patterns twice, node 20, and Next 14 with App Router, as well as break down confusing and disparate legacy redux patterns. All with well-structured agile methodologies: code reviews, sprint planning, retro and refinement meetings.

EDD London: Jul 2022 - Apr 2023

An agency role where projects included two booking platforms and a CMSd showcase site for the agency itself (which I also did the photography for). All involved prototyping components in TypeScript, React and Storybook before integrating them into a dynamic SSR Next.JS app. Lead two developers on building and integrating React components.

For a booking system project I built a UI library extending Chakra UI with custom components to take advantage of their theming system and laying the groundwork for a white label offering.

Fun new things included React Hook Forms, server-side rendering with Next.js 14 and Gatsby, mocking with Faker & MSW, state and data fetching with React Query, animation with framer motion, and for the CMS content I consumed a custom Headless CMS.
