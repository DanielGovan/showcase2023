        Lorem I worked on Octopart for about 2 years, starting in 2021. It was a
        fantastic project that allowed me to work with a talented team and
        contribute to a product that helps engineers find electronic parts.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        Lorem The project involved building a robust search engine, implementing
        a design system, and optimizing the site for performance and SEO. We
        used modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and GraphQL to
        create a seamless user experience. The team was focused on delivering
        high-quality code and ensuring that the site was accessible and
        performant.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        Lorem One of the key challenges was integrating the search functionality
        with the existing backend systems. We had to ensure that the search
        results were accurate and relevant, which required close collaboration
        with the backend team. Additionally, we worked on improving the
        site&rsquo;s SEO to increase visibility and drive more traffic. This
        involved optimizing the site&rsquo;s structure, metadata, and content to
        align with best practices.
      </Para>

        working in a collaborative environment, and delivering features that
        have a real impact on users. The project not only enhanced my technical
        skills but also deepened my understanding of user-centered design and
        the importance of performance and accessibility in web development.
