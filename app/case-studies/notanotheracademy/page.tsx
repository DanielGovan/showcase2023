        Lorem I worked on Not Another Salon for about 2 years, starting in 2021.
        It was a fantastic project that allowed me to work with a talented team
        and contribute to a product that helps people find and book hair and
        beauty services.

      <Para>
        Lorem The project involved building a robust booking system,
        implementing a design system, and optimizing the site for performance
        and SEO. We used modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and
        GraphQL to create a seamless user experience. The team was focused on
        delivering high-quality code and ensuring that the site was accessible
        and performant.
