        I thrive in cross-functional teams that value collaboration, curiosity,
        &amp; smart, scalable solutions. With an expertise in React, Typescript
        &amp; the modern front-end stack, paired with a sharp design eye &amp;
        UX focus, I bring a pragmatic approach to everything from shipping
        scalable UI libraries, leading design system rollouts, to levelling up
        legacy platforms. I&rsquo;m looking to join a forward-thinking team
        where I can keep learning, building, &amp; making an impact.
