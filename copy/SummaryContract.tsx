        I combine expertise in React, TypeScript, and the modern front-end stack
        with a sharp eye for design and a strong focus on UX. Whether it&rsquo;s
        shipping scalable UI libraries, leading design system rollouts, or
        levelling up legacy platforms, I bring a pragmatic, impact-driven
        approach to every project.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        With 10 years experience in contract roles, I&rsquo;m also well-versed
        in quickly adapting to new teams and environments. I love diving into
        new codebases to pick up and improve on established patterns, and
        I&rsquo;m eager to join a cross-functional team that values innovation
        and quality.
      </Para>
