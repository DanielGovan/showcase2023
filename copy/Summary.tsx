        I combine expertise in React, TypeScript, and the modern front-end stack
        with a sharp eye for design and a strong focus on UX. Whether it&rsquo;s
        shipping scalable UI libraries, leading design system rollouts, or
        levelling up legacy platforms, I bring a pragmatic, impact-driven
        approach to every project.

      <Para>
        After a successful decade in contract roles, I&rsquo;m also well-versed
        in quickly adapting to new teams and environments. I love diving into
        new codebases to pick up and improve on established patterns. But now
        I&rsquo;ve had a taste of building product and processes with an
        in-house team, and I&rsquo;m keen to join somewhere I can help shape the
        tech and culture over the long term.
