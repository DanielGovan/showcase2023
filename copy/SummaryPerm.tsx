        I thrive in cross-functional teams that value collaboration, curiosity,
        &amp; smart, scalable solutions. With an expertise in React, Typescript
        &amp; the modern front-end stack, paired with a sharp design eye &amp;
        UX focus, I bring a pragmatic approach to everything from shipping
        scalable UI libraries, leading design system rollouts, to levelling up
        legacy platforms.

        After a successful decade of freelancing and contract gigs, I&rsquo;m
        keen to go deep with a product team where I can help shape the direction
        of tech, and reap the dividends of the processes and DX improvements I
        put in place, to build something meaningful together.
