      <Para>
        I combine expertise in React, TypeScript, and the modern front-end stack
        with a sharp eye for design and a strong focus on UX. Whether it&rsquo;s
        shipping scalable UI libraries, leading design system rollouts, or
        levelling up legacy platforms, I bring a pragmatic, impact-driven
        approach to every project.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        After a successful decade of freelancing and contract work, I&rsquo;m
        ready to go deep with an in-house product team; somewhere I can help
        shape the tech, culture, and processes while building something
        meaningful together over the long term.
      </Para>
